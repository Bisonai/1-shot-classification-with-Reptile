# 1-shot classification with Reptile

Unofficial implementation of meta-learning algorithm called [Reptile](https://openai.com/blog/reptile/) and described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02999). This repository contains a pre-trained model with the Omniglot dataset using Reptile for three classes. We provide a test this pre-trained model on three different dataset with a 1-shot classification.

## Demos

In the following examples, there are three classes with one example for each. Moreover, we are interested to predict the class of an additional image.

This demo is available in a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/adelshb/fine-tuning-for-reptile/blob/master/demo.ipynb) format. The images are from this [blogpost](https://openai.com/blog/reptile/) from [OpenAI](https://openai.com).
